"""Post-migration verification for the migration-safety CI job.

Asserts that the database is still queryable after a fresh round of
``run_migrations`` against a populated dataset:

- every expected table exists
- row counts are non-zero (seeded data wasn't accidentally wiped)
- a couple of typical relational queries still execute without error
